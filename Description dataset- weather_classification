## Description
This dataset is synthetically generated to mimic weather data for classification tasks.
It includes various weather-related features and categorizes the weather into four types: Rainy, Sunny, Cloudy, and Snowy. 
This dataset is designed for practicing classification algorithms, data preprocessing, and outlier detection methods.

# Variables
Temperature (numeric): The temperature in degrees Celsius, ranging from extreme cold to extreme heat.
Humidity (numeric): The humidity percentage, including values above 100% to introduce outliers.
Wind Speed (numeric): The wind speed in kilometers per hour, with a range including unrealistically high values.
Precipitation (%) (numeric): The precipitation percentage, including outlier values.
Cloud Cover (categorical): The cloud cover description.
Atmospheric Pressure (numeric): The atmospheric pressure in hPa, covering a wide range.
UV Index (numeric): The UV index, indicating the strength of ultraviolet radiation.
Season (categorical): The season during which the data was recorded.
Visibility (km) (numeric): The visibility in kilometers, including very low or very high values.
Location (categorical): The type of location where the data was recorded.
Weather Type (categorical): The target variable for classification, indicating the weather type.
